## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

- **Vault Initialization:** First-time users must set a Master Spell (password)
- **Key Derivation:** Uses `PBKDF2-HMAC` + a custom salt to derive encryption key
- **Vault Locking:** All data is encrypted to a `.vault` file on save or update
- **Unlocking:** Users must input the correct Master Spell to decrypt vault

## üîê Encryption Details

- **Encryption:** AES-128 CBC via [`cryptography.fernet`](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/fernet/)
- **KDF:** `PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256` with custom static salt
- **Storage Format:** Encrypted binary file with `.vault` extension
